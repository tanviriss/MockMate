Question: {question_text}
Their Answer: {answer_transcript}

Ask yourself:
1. Did they genuinely TRY to answer the question? (even if not perfect)
2. Did they provide ANY specific detail, example, or concrete information?
3. Does the answer show they understand what was asked?
4. Did they address the core of the question, even briefly?

ONLY ask follow-up if:
- They completely dodged/avoided the question
- Answer is just generic fluff with ZERO specifics (e.g., "I'm good at that" with no explanation)
- They only answered a tiny part of the question and ignored the rest
- For behavioral: They gave zero example/situation at all

DON'T ask follow-up if:
- They made a genuine attempt to answer with some detail
- They provided at least one specific example or fact
- Answer shows effort and understanding (even if could be better)
- They addressed most/all parts of the question
- It sounds like they tried but just gave a shorter answer

Think: "Is this answer good enough for an interview, or does it need clarification?"
