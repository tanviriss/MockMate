**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Questions must match REAL interview patterns (direct, concise, no fluff)
2. Use exact phrasing that real interviewers use
3. NO personalized/conversational style ("You mentioned...", "That's interesting...")
4. Based on known {company_name} interview patterns from Glassdoor/Blind/LeetCode

**Question Types for {company_name}:**
- Technical concept questions (50%): "What's the difference between X and Y?", "Explain how X works"
- Behavioral questions (30%): "Tell me about a time...", "Describe a situation..."
- System design (10%): "Design a [system]", "How would you build..."
- Experience questions (10%): "Walk me through a project", "What's the most challenging..."

**Examples of GOOD questions:**
✓ "What's the difference between a process and a thread?"
✓ "Explain how garbage collection works in Java"
✓ "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager"
✓ "Design a URL shortening service like bit.ly"
✓ "How would you optimize a slow database query?"

**AVOID these patterns:**
✗ "I see you've worked with Python. Can you tell me about..."
✗ "Your background is quite impressive! Let's talk about..."
✗ "You mentioned in your resume..."
