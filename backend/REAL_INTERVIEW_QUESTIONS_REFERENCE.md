## Key Patterns to Notice

### ✅ GOOD Question Patterns (Use These):
1. **Direct concept questions**: "What is X?" / "Explain Y" / "Difference between X and Y?"
2. **STAR behavioral**: "Tell me about a time..." / "Describe a situation..."
3. **Open project**: "Walk me through..." / "What's the most..."
4. **Technical how-to**: "How would you..." / "How does X work?"

### ❌ BAD Question Patterns (Avoid These):
1. **Personalized references**: "You mentioned..." / "I see you have..."
2. **Conversational fluff**: "That's interesting!" / "Fascinating!"
3. **Compliments**: "Your project sounds great!"
4. **Narrative style**: "Can you walk me through your journey..."
