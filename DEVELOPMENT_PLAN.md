## 📝 Notes for Development

### Best Practices
1. **Test Early, Test Often**: Write tests as you build features
2. **Commit Frequently**: Small, atomic commits with clear messages
3. **Document As You Go**: Update docs when you add features
4. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets, always use .env
5. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully
6. **User Feedback**: Show loading states, success messages, errors clearly

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't skip authentication testing
- Don't forget to handle WebSocket disconnections
- Don't ignore rate limits on free tier APIs
- Don't store sensitive data in localStorage
- Don't skip mobile responsive testing
- Don't forget to implement cleanup (delete old audio files)
